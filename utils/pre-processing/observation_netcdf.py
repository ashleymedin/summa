"""Write an observed series in the NetCDF form every SUMMA calibration target reads.

The form is the one the bundled streamflow observations already use: a `time` coordinate with CF
units, and one named variable carrying its own units, missing values as NaN.  Keeping every kind of
observation in that one shape is what lets the model read them all with one routine.

Each time stamps the END of the span the value covers, which is how the calibration aligns a series:
an observation is compared against the simulation averaged over the span since the observation
before it.  The span itself is written too, as CF `time_bnds`, so the file says what it means
without the reader having to assume it.
